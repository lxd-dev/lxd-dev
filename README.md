# Hi There!

I'm Lx, a newbie programmer on a mission to turn caffeine and curiosity into code : )

## I'm here to:
- Build up my skill set
- Share my baby steps in programming
- Break things, fix them (hopefully), and learn along the way

## What I'm playing with (coding-wide):
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React, Node.js
- Java, Python

## What I'm playing with (actual games):
- *Ring Fit Adventure*
- *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (saving Hyrule...slowly...in between coding sessions)
